        <p>
          <b>api-docs</b> is a minimalist toolkit for producing
          great documentation. The intent of
          this toolkit is to make larger documentation projects
          more approachable, like the sort that are needed for
          documenting cross-platform and web service APIs.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's no database here, no code generation, no new 
          syntaxes to learn. You'll compose your docs using
          <b>HTML</b>, optionally making use of some 
          <a href="#special-tags">special tags</a>
          we've design just for marking up source code, and build
          your doc file with a simple Grunt script.
        </p>
        <p>
          The documentation you're reading now was built using
          <b>api-docs</b>, so if you like what you see, you're
          half way there.
