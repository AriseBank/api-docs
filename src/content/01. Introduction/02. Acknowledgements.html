          api-docs wouldn't look so amazing were it not
          for the example set by the team at 
          <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank">Stripe</a>.
          A quick look at their 
          <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api" target="_blank">API reference documentation</a>
          and you'll be able to see why. 
          It was my experience working with their product and 
          their docs that first inspired me to look for a platform 
          on which to write my own beautiful docs, leading
          eventually to building api-docs.
